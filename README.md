Weather forecast application
I have created this application using Java langauge and Designing is done via XML.
I have used Volley for JSON parsing and getting weather information from weatherapi.com.
This application will access your GPS and provide current weather status, temperature, current weather conditiom and hourly weather forecast of the whole day which includes temperature and wind speed.
This app also have manual search feature through which you can get weather information about any place in the world.
